## React DOM

Now that we've learned about component definitions and their instantiation, we can move to the App component's instantiation. It has been in our application from the start, in the *src/index.js* file:

{title="src/index.js",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~
import * as React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
~~~~~~~

Next to React which is imported from `react`, there is another imported library called `react-dom`, in which a `ReactDOM.render()` function uses an HTML node to replace it with JSX. Essentially that's everything needed to integrate React into any application which uses HTML. In more detail, `ReactDOM.render()` expects two arguments; the first is to render the JSX. It creates an instance of your App component, though it can also pass simple JSX without any component instantiation:

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello React World</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
~~~~~~~

The second argument specifies where the React application enters your HTML. It expects an element with an `id='root'`, found in the *public/index.html* file. This is a basic HTML file.

### Exercises:

* Open the *public/index.html* to see where the React application enters your HTML.
* Read more about [rendering elements in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html).
