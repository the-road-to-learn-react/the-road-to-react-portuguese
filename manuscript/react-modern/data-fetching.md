## Data Fetching with React

We are currently fetching data, but it's still pseudo data coming from a promise we set up ourselves. The lessons up to now about asynchronous React and advanced state management were preparing us to fetch data from a real remote third-party API. We will use the reliable and informative [Hacker News API](https://hn.algolia.com/api) to request popular tech stories.

Instead of using the `initialStories` array and `getAsyncStories` function (you can remove these), we will fetch the data directly from the API:

{title="src/App.js",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~
// A
# leanpub-start-insert
const API_ENDPOINT = 'https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=';
# leanpub-end-insert

const App = () => {
  ...

  React.useEffect(() => {
    dispatchStories({ type: 'STORIES_FETCH_INIT' });

# leanpub-start-insert
    fetch(`${API_ENDPOINT}react`) // B
      .then((response) => response.json()) // C
# leanpub-end-insert
      .then((result) => {
        dispatchStories({
          type: 'STORIES_FETCH_SUCCESS',
# leanpub-start-insert
          payload: result.hits, // D
# leanpub-end-insert
        });
      })
      .catch(() =>
        dispatchStories({ type: 'STORIES_FETCH_FAILURE' })
      );
  }, []);

  ...
};
~~~~~~~

First, the `API_ENDPOINT` (A) is used to fetch popular tech stories for a certain query (a search term). In this case, we fetch stories about React (B). Second, the native browser's [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) is used to make this request (B). For the fetch API, the response needs to be translated into JSON (C). Finally, the returned result follows a different data structure (D), which we send as payload to our component's state reducer.

In the previous code example, we used [JavaScript's Template Literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) for a string interpolation. When this feature wasn't available in JavaScript, we'd have used the + operator on strings instead:

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~
const greeting = 'Hello';

// + operator
const welcome = greeting + ' React';
console.log(welcome);
// Hello React

// template literals
const anotherWelcome = `${greeting} React`;
console.log(anotherWelcome);
// Hello React
~~~~~~~

Check your browser to see stories related to the initial query fetched from the Hacker News API. Since we used the same data structure for a story for the sample stories, we didn't need to change anything, and it's still possible to filter the stories after fetching them with the search feature. We will change this behavior in one of the next sections though.
